				<h3>What is Big Data? </h3>
				<div class="separator"></div>
                <p>	Big data is the collection of immense data sets that are varied and complex in structure. The data collected is generated by: search queries, online transactions, health records, stock market trading, business documents, social networking and taxes. There are many more sources for data but these are just some large categories to show you where we get the information from. With the increase in data, it has become difficult to visualize and analyze this data. This is where informatics professionals help to make the lives of non-technical people easier.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Big data is characterized into three components known as variety, velocity and volume. <img src="assets/images/threevs.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" class="floatright"/>When variety comes in as structured to the data warehouse, it can be easily sorted and stored in the proper place. Things get difficult when the data comes in unstructured, making it strenuous to access and analyse properly. Volume is refers to the magnitude of the data that we store. Data is already being stored in the Zettabyte. To put this in perspective, by 2020 fifty billion devices will be connected to the internet. Each generating their own unique data set to be processed and analyzed. Lastly, velocity is the time that the organization retrieves the data. The sooner it is acquired, the more useful the data will be. </p>
				<br>
				<p>The Mckinsey Global Insitute stated that the potential of big data will affect five main topics: healthcare, public & private sectors, retail, manufacturing and personal location data. Healthcare will become more personalized as individual analytics are widely accessible. It will also lead to better treatments as machine learning algorithms are used to understand diseases.  The public and private sector will improve its products and services by being able to automate more systems. Behavioral analysis and web-based markets will become more prevalent in the retail industry.  Supply chain management will be more efficient in manufacturing and sales support will become easier. Smart routing and GPS tracking will be smarter than ever with all of this data.  </p>

				<p>There are many different methods that humans are using to make sense of all the data that is being generated. High Performance Computing Clustering and Hadoop Stack are two ways to accomplish this task. The comparison of the methods is pictured in the graphic above. The end goal for big data is to make sense of it all to make our lives easier.  </p>
